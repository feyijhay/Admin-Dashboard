ADMIN DASHBOARD FOR SaaS PLATFORM

PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Admin Dashboard for a SaaS platform serves as a professional full-stack project to showcase skills in both frontend and backend development. The dashboard will handle user authentication, data management, analytics, and real-time notifications, providing an intuitive interface for admins.

This project will be completed in 3 weeks and deployed live on cloud platforms, ensuring the solution is both functional and ready for production.

KEY FEATURES

User Authentication (Backend Focus - Baliqis)
Role-based authentication:

Admins can manage users and data.

Regular users can view their data but have limited access.

JWT authentication with refresh tokens.

Analytics Dashboard (Frontend Focus - Dayo)
Display key metrics:

Total users, active users, new signups, etc.

Revenue trends using charts (e.g., Chart.js or D3.js).

Dynamic filtering for analytics (e.g., filter by date range, user type).

CRUD Operations (Full-Stack - David and Baliqis)
Admins can:

Add, update, and delete users and data records.

Assign roles (e.g., “viewer,” “editor,” “admin”).

Frontend forms for CRUD actions, integrated with backend APIs.

Real-Time Notifications (Optional, Backend Focus)
Notify admins of key events (e.g., new user signup) using Socket.io or WebSockets.

Modern UI/UX Design (Frontend Focus - Dayo and David)
Use Material UI or Tailwind CSS for a clean, professional look.

Ensure full responsiveness (mobile and desktop-friendly).

Technology Stack

Frontend (Dayo and David):
React.js for building the user interface.

Redux Toolkit for state management.

Chart.js or D3.js for data visualisation.

Material UI or Tailwind CSS for modern UI design.

Backend (Baliqis):

Node.js and Express.js for API development.

MongoDB for database management.

JWT Authentication for user security.

Socket.io (optional) for real-time notifications.

Cloud Deployment:

Frontend: Host on Vercel or Netlify.

Backend: Host on AWS (Elastic Beanstalk) or Heroku.

Database: Use MongoDB Atlas for a managed cloud database.
